# Files and Folders Pattern Matching

This Python script provides functionality to traverse a directory, search for specific folders and files based on regex patterns, and analyze the distribution of those files. It is useful for exploring directory structures, collecting file information, and visualizing the distribution of files within folders.

## Overview

The main class in this script is `FilesAndFoldersInDirectory`, which contains methods for traversing a directory, matching folders and files based on user-defined patterns, and performing various operations such as counting, sampling, and visualizing the data.

### Key Features:
- **Pattern-based directory traversal:** Search for folders and files using regular expressions.
- **Limit the search:** Stop the search once a certain number of matches (limit) are found.
- **File distribution analysis:** Visualize the distribution of files in matching folders.
- **Random sampling of matched files:** Output a random sample of files and folders.
- **Random folder selection:** Pick a folder containing a specific number of files and display its contents.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `numpy`

You can install these dependencies via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/import-and-eda.git
   cd import-and-eda
   ```

2. **Running the Script:**

   The class `FilesAndFoldersInDirectory` requires the following arguments when initialized:

   - `directory_path` (str): The root directory from where the search begins.
   - `folder_name` (str): A description of the folder type being searched.
   - `folder_pattern` (str): A regex pattern to match folder names.
   - `file_name` (str): A description of the file type being searched.
   - `pattern` (str): A regex pattern to match file names.
   - `limit` (int): The maximum number of matched files to retrieve.

3. **Example Usage:**
   
   ```python
   from your_script import FilesAndFoldersInDirectory

   directory = '/path/to/directory'
   folder_name = 'Submissions'
   folder_pattern = r'Submissions_*'
   file_name = 'PDF'
   file_pattern = r'.*\.pdf'
   limit = 100

   files_folders = FilesAndFoldersInDirectory(directory, folder_name, folder_pattern, file_name, file_pattern, limit)
   
   # Retrieve and display matched files
   files_folders.retrieve_pattern_matched_files()
   
   # Show distribution of files in matching folders
   files_folders.distribution_of_files_in_folders()

   # Show a random folder with a specific number of matching files
   files_folders.show_files_in_random_folder(frequency=5)
   ```

## Class Methods

### `retrieve_pattern_matched_files()`
- **Description:** This method traverses the directory, matches folders and files based on the provided regex patterns, and retrieves a list of files up to the specified limit. It then prints a random sample of 10 matched files.
- **Output:** 
  - A list of matched files.
  - A sample of randomly selected files.

### `distribution_of_files_in_folders()`
- **Description:** This method calculates the number of files in each folder that match the provided file pattern. It also creates a bar plot showing the distribution of file counts across folders.
- **Output:** 
  - A pandas DataFrame with folder names and corresponding file counts.
  - A histogram showing the distribution of files.
  - A list of folders grouped by the number of matched files.

### `show_files_in_random_folder(frequency)`
- **Description:** This method randomly selects a folder containing a specific number of matched files (given by the `frequency` parameter) and lists the file names inside that folder.
- **Input:** 
  - `frequency` (int): The number of matched files to look for in the folder.
- **Output:** 
  - The path to a randomly selected folder and its file contents.

## Example Workflow

Hereâ€™s how you can use this script in a typical workflow:

1. **Initialize the Class:**
   Provide the directory path and regex patterns to filter folders and files.

2. **Retrieve Files:**
   Use the `retrieve_pattern_matched_files()` method to search for files that match the pattern and retrieve up to the specified limit.

3. **Visualize Distribution:**
   Call `distribution_of_files_in_folders()` to visualize how the files are distributed across the folders and generate a bar plot.

4. **Inspect Random Folder:**
   Use `show_files_in_random_folder(frequency)` to inspect a random folder containing a specified number of files.
